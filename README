This is an automated Java converter from Java Language to any other target.
Code is self-explanatory if one is aware of ANTLRv3 related project
and beyond. Code is based on many developers work, especially of ANTLR
community. Underling principle is to have Java grammar which is used for basic
scanning and parsing, and after that to exploit Generator grammar together
with respective StringTemplateGroup of a target language:

  Java.g -> Generator.g -> <Target.stg>
